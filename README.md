This project consists of a simple website that uses LocalStorage (cookies) to simulate a database. This is my first website project done for User Intefaces course @ uc3m.
[You can visit the page through this link](https://witty-flower-0e2416c03.azurestaticapps.net)

The page should work on most browsers. Keep in mind that since it uses cookies for loading page content, some browsers like Safari seem to not work properly. This is just a school project, nothing professional :)
